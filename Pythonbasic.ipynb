        " Type casting, also known as type conversion, in Python refers to the process of converting a variable or value from one data type to another. This is often necessary when performing operations that require specific data types, or when data is received in a format different from what is needed for processing.\n",
        "There are two main types of type conversion in Python:\n",
        "Implicit Type Conversion (Coercion): This occurs automatically when Python converts one data type to another without explicit instruction from the programmer. This usually happens in expressions involving different numeric types, where Python promotes the \"smaller\" type to the \"larger\" type to avoid data loss.\n",

        "Python\n",
        "\n",
        "    integer_value = 10\n",
        "    float_value = 5.5\n",
        "    result = integer_value + float_value\n",
        "    print(result)\n",
        "    print(type(result))\n",
        "In this example, the integer integer_value is implicitly converted to a float before the addition, resulting in a float result.\n",
        "\n",
        "Explicit Type Conversion (Type Casting): This requires the programmer to explicitly convert a data type using built-in functions. These functions include int(), float(), str(), list(), tuple(), set(), etc. Explicit conversion is used when the desired type is not automatically inferred or when a specific conversion is required, even if it might involve potential data loss (e.g., converting a float to an integer truncates the decimal part).\n",
        "Examples:\n",
        "Python\n",
        "\n",
        "    # Converting a string to an integer\n",
        "    string_number = \"123\"\n",

        "    print(integer_number)\n",
        "    print(type(integer_number))\n",
        "\n",
        "    # Converting a float to an integer\n",
        "    float_num = 7.89\n",
        "    integer_from_float = int(float_num)\n",
        "    print(integer_from_float) # Output: 7 (decimal part is truncated)\n",
        "    print(type(integer_from_float))\n",
