        "A method is a function defined inside a class definition. It is \"bound\" to an object (an instance of that class) and is called on that object using dot notation (e.g., object.method_name()). A method always implicitly (or explicitly for instance methods) receives the object instance as its first argument (conventionally named self).\n",

        "\n",
        "Arguments are the actual, concrete values that are passed into the function when it is called. These values are assigned to the corresponding parameters when the function executes.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Once defined, functions can be called in several ways, primarily concerning how arguments are passed:\n",

        "5. What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n",
        "\n",
        "An Iterable is an object that can be looped over. Technically, it is any object that implements the __iter__() method, which must return an iterator. Examples of iterables include lists, strings, tuples, dictionaries, and sets.\n",
        "\n",
        "An Iterator is an object that represents a stream of data; it produces the next item in the sequence when asked. An iterator must implement both the __iter__() method (which just returns itself) and the __next__() method. The __next__() method retrieves the next item and raises a StopIteration exception when the stream is exhausted.\n",
        "\n",
        "Iterators maintain their current state (they know which item they returned last). An iterable, like a list, does not maintain state; you must first get an iterator from it (using the built-in iter() function) to begin iteration.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "Python\n",
        "\n",
        "my_list = [10, 20] # This list is an ITERABLE.\n",

        "# Get an iterator FROM the iterable:\n",

        "\n",
        "# Using the ITERATOR:\n",
        "print(next(my_iterator)) # Output: 10 (State is now at the first item)\n",
        "print(next(my_iterator)) # Output: 20 (State is now at the second item)\n",
        "# print(next(my_iterator)) # This would raise StopIteration\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n",
        "\n",
        "A generator is a special type of function that creates an iterator in a simpler way. Generators \"generate\" values one at a time (known as lazy evaluation) rather than building an entire list in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "Generators are defined like normal functions, but they use the yield keyword instead of return to send back a value. When yield is hit, the function pauses its execution, saves its state (all local variables), and sends the value to the caller. When the iterator's next() method is called again, the function resumes exactly where it left off.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example (Generator Function):\n",
        "\n",
        "Python\n",
        "\n",
        "# This defines a generator that yields 0, 1, 2\n",
        "def count_to_three():\n",
        "  print(\"Yielding 0\")\n",
        "  yield 0\n",
        "  print(\"Resuming... Yielding 1\")\n",
        "  yield 1\n",
        "  print(\"Resuming... Yielding 2\")\n",
        "  yield 2\n",
        "\n",
        "# Calling the function returns a generator (iterator) object\n",
        "counter = count_to_three()\n",
        "\n",
        "next(counter) # Output: \"Yielding 0\" (and returns 0)\n",
        "next(counter) # Output: \"Resuming... Yielding 1\" (and returns 1)\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n",
        "\n",
        "The primary advantage of generators (which return iterators) over regular functions (which might return a full list) is memory efficiency.\n",
        "\n",
        "Generators use lazy evaluation; they compute and yield values only when requested (one at a time). A regular function must compute all the values, store them in a list (which uses memory), and return that entire list.\n",
        "\n",
        "This makes generators essential for:\n",
        "\n",
        "Working with extremely large datasets (like reading a multi-gigabyte log file).\n",
        "\n",
        "Representing infinite sequences (like the Fibonacci sequence or counting indefinitely).\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: If you needed the squares of numbers up to one billion:\n",
        "\n",
        "Regular Function: def get_squares(n): return [i*i for i in range(n)] (Calling this with n=1_000_000_000 would crash the computer by trying to build a list with a billion numbers).\n",
        "\n",
        "Generator Function: def gen_squares(n): for i in range(n): yield i*i (This uses almost no memory, as it only computes one square when asked).\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n",
        "\n",
        "A lambda function is a small, single-line, anonymous function (meaning it doesn't need a name via def). It is defined using the lambda keyword.\n",
        "\n",
        "The syntax is: lambda arguments: expression\n",
        "\n",
        "It can have any number of arguments but only one expression (which is the value it implicitly returns).\n",
        "\n",
        "Lambda functions are typically used when you need a very simple, temporary function for a short period, most often as an argument to a higher-order function (a function that takes another function as an input), such as map(), filter(), or list.sort().\n",
        "\n",
        "Example (Usage with sort):\n",
        "\n",
        "Python\n",
        "\n",
        "# Sort a list of tuples by their second item (index 1)\n",

        "\n",
        "# Use a lambda function as the 'key' argument\n",
        "data.sort(key=lambda item: item[1])\n",
        "\n",
        "print(data) # Output: [(3, 2), (1, 5), (9, 8)]\n",
        "\n",
        "9. Explain the purpose and usage of the map() function in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "The map(function, iterable) function applies a specified function to every item in an iterable (like a list) and returns an iterator (a map object) containing the results of that transformation. It does not modify the original list.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is used when you need to transform every element of a sequence in the same way.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "Python\n",
        "\n",
        "def double(n):\n",
